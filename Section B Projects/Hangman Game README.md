Simple Hangman Coding Exercise I took to the next level with a host of features typically not found in submissions of this kind of exercise

I had a particular amount of fun manipulating strings and assessing every possibility from ensuring the code knows the difference between Proper Nouns and a lot of features for users that play the game including a definition function which was particulary useful as by simply running the code I have even improved my own vocabulary, which in essence is what coding is all about -> Providing Solutions and Ideas in Code to enhance or improve a person's life in some capacity.

Feel free to keep track of my repo @ https://github.com/IntuitiveOne/PythonResume/ as I may add additional projects and coding exercises as I learn and improve on my abilty

IMPORTANT

Simply copying the code to VS Studio or another IDE should be sufficient for it to run, however do not forget to install the appropiate libaries for complete functionality

pip install worknik
pip install PyDictionary
pip install textblob
